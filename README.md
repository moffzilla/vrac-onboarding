# vrac-onboarding
Python v3 Based functions to on-boarding VMs after they have been moved from one cloud to another
The script leverages vRAC APIs but it can easily updated for vRA 8.X

Note: The code is crafted as the art of the possible by the TMM team. This is not a VMware supported solution, nor is it recommended for a production environment without the appropiate changes.
